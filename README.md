### How to use
1. Download and unzip this project. Alternatively: Clone this project in Git.
2. Check if you have a [location history][2]. If you have no location history [learn about enabling the service][3] â€“ If you don't mind Google getting a lot of private data from you.
3. Get your location history from [Google Takeout][4]
4. Copy your _LocationHistory.json_ to the project folder. Not that the filename is localized. Here in Germany it's named _Standortverlauf_. Rename your location history file to _LocationHistory.json_, if it's not alread named that way.
5. Install [node.js][5] on your machine.
6. Go to your favorite shell and run the command `node convert.js` inside the project folder.
7. Open the _index.html_ and enjoy.

### ToDos
* Add some kind of clustering alogorithm (k-Means?) to reduce the file size. Right now one year of location gatherings is about 9 MB. 
* Add support for node arguments, so you can call `node convert.js myfile.json`
* Add tests for the automatic LatLongBox calculation

Have fun and use the code for your own projects.
